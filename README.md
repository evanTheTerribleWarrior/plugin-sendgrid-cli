### !!! Important !!! (This message will be deleted when the work is complete)
This repo is work in progress. It will keep being updated until pretty much all the v3 API is included
Reference of the API is [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference)

Also if you clone it and want to test with the Twilio CLI locally, the instructions are [here](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-cli/blob/main/docs/plugins.md)

To be able to run this locally, also you need to add your SG Key
`cp .env.example .env`
