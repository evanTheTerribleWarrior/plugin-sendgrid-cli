TODO after 1st pass:
---> Add optional limits to array flag

===========================================

- limit flag is integer, not string
- test auth domains on subusers
- design APIs don't have on behalf of

Domains:
Add IP ---> throws 400

Subusers:
Reputation seems to be a string for "usernames", how to put multiple?
Why when creating a subuser, assigning IPs is required?

There are several endpoints (like IP warmup for example) without on-behalf-of, would it not work?

Mail Settings:
Retrieve all -  Limit and offset not working? How to use them?

Why an email address is both on path and query param



=======================
Sections to be done
Deliverability:
---> Email Validation: It gives 403, but not from Postman??
---> Sender Verification
---> IP address management

Why on Stats we don't put all the other sections under /v3/stats/ ?

Re-do the Designs with the new flags

why offset is a string
